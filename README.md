# PawPal+ (Module 2 Project)

You are building **PawPal+**, a Streamlit app that helps a pet owner plan care tasks for their pet.

## Scenario

A busy pet owner needs help staying consistent with pet care. They want an assistant that can:

- Track pet care tasks (walks, feeding, meds, enrichment, grooming, etc.)
- Consider constraints (time available, priority, owner preferences)
- Produce a daily plan and explain why it chose that plan

Your job is to design the system first (UML), then implement the logic in Python, then connect it to the Streamlit UI.

## What you will build

Your final app should:

- Let a user enter basic owner + pet info
- Let a user add/edit tasks (duration + priority at minimum)
- Generate a daily schedule/plan based on constraints and priorities
- Display the plan clearly (and ideally explain the reasoning)
- Include tests for the most important scheduling behaviors

## Getting started

### Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Suggested workflow

1. Read the scenario carefully and identify requirements and edge cases.
2. Draft a UML diagram (classes, attributes, methods, relationships).
3. Convert UML into Python class stubs (no logic yet).
4. Implement scheduling logic in small increments.
5. Add tests to verify key behaviors.
6. Connect your logic to the Streamlit UI in `app.py`.
7. Refine UML so it matches what you actually built.


## Smarter Scheduling

PawPal+ includes several scheduling improvements:
- Sorts tasks by date and time
- Filters tasks by pet name or completion status
- Automatically creates the next task for daily or weekly recurring events
- Detects simple scheduling conflicts when two tasks are set for the same exact time


## Testing PawPal+

Run the automated tests with:

```bash
python -m pytest

My tests cover the main backend features of PawPal+. They check that a task can be marked complete, that adding a task to a pet increases the pet’s task count, that tasks are sorted in the correct time order, that recurring tasks create a new future task when completed, that conflicts are detected when two tasks have the same time, and that filtering works by task status and pet name.
